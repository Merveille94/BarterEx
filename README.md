## Project Inspiration

BarterEx was born out of the need to modernize the barter trade system, especially in regions like Ghana where traditional bartering is still common. The goal was to create a seamless and digital solution to make trading more accessible and organized for individuals and small businesses.  

Our biggest challenge was figuring out how to make the app both functional and visually appealing, while ensuring security and scalability. Through trial and error, especially with API integration and handling real-time updates, we learned valuable lessons that made our app better.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

**Technical Challenges**  
- Integrating the authentication system was initially challenging as we had to ensure the security of user data while keeping the system scalable.
- Real-time updates between the frontend and backend using WebSockets were tricky to implement but greatly improved the user experience for messaging and notifications.

**Whatâ€™s Next?**  
- In the next iteration, we plan to integrate a location-based feature that helps users find trades near their location using GPS. We also aim to implement a mobile version of the app using React Native.
